## Future improvements
Since we used monthly data for this project, for future improvements, we may use daily data to obtain more accurate price and volume of Bitcoin.
With more accurate data, we can potentially do a prediction using Machine Learning models as well.


## Conclusion
As from our analysis, it shows that long-term holding of bitcoin can be profitbale. On the other hand, short-term investment can be very risky since the price of bitcoin is volatile comparing to other investment types.
I wish you all good luck!
